Repository for Module 4

In this repository is the analysis of data about students passing a standardized math and reading test based on district. It contains a Resources folder of the original data. It also contains a document called PyCitySchools.ipynb. In this file, conclusions about the data are drawn at top. Below are databases comparing several different factors.

# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview

In the PyCity Schools project, we embark on a comprehensive analysis of district-wide school performance. Leveraging the power of Pandas in Jupyter Notebook, this project dissects a large dataset of school and student performance to uncover insights and trends that inform better decision-making within the educational sector. This README outlines the project's scope, including its objectives, the technologies employed, and the analytical methodologies utilized.

## Project Objectives

The project's primary objective is to analyze school performance data to provide a snapshot of the district's overall performance and identify key trends and insights. The analysis encompasses various metrics, including:

- **District Summary:** A high-level overview of key metrics across all schools.
- **School Summary:** Individual performance metrics for each school.
- **Performance Analysis:** Identifying high and low-performing schools.
- **Grade-Level Performance:** Math and reading scores by grade.
- **Spending, Size, and Type Analysis:** Examining the impact of funding, school size, and type on performance.

## Key Deliverables

1. **District Summary DataFrame:** A summary of district-wide key metrics.
2. **School Summary DataFrame:** Key metrics summarized for each school.
3. **Top and Bottom Performing Schools:** Schools ranked by overall passing rate.
4. **Math and Reading Scores by Grade:** Average scores for each grade level within each school.
5. **Scores by School Spending, Size, and Type:** Analysis of how spending per student, school size, and type affect school performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For scripting and performing calculations.
- **Pandas Library:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** As an IDE for writing Python code and presenting the analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through this project, I have demonstrated:

- Proficiency in using Pandas for complex data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- Ability to use Jupyter Notebook for developing, documenting, and presenting data analysis projects.
- Understanding of data analysis techniques to draw meaningful insights from large datasets.
- Application of Python scripting to automate data processing tasks.

## Conclusion

The PyCity Schools analysis project serves as a testament to the power of Python and Pandas in making data-driven decisions in the education sector. This project not only showcases my analytical skills but also my ability to use technology to uncover trends that can lead to actionable insights and improved outcomes.
